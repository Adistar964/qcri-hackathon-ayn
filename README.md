## 🗣️ Voice Commands  
The **voice mode** answers questions **based on previously captured images or descriptions** (it cannot access the camera live).  

### How It Works:  
1. **First**, capture an image in **Describe** or **Read** mode.  
2. **Then**, tap the 🎤 **Microphone button** and ask about what was detected.  

### Example Questions:  
- *"What did you see earlier?"*  
- *"Read the text again."*  
- *"Describe the last photo."*  
- *"What was the medication name?"*  

The app will respond using context from the last captured image or scan.  

### Note:  
- ❌ Voice commands **cannot** analyze new scenes in real-time—only saved results.  
- ✅ For live descriptions, use **Describe Mode** instead.

## ⚠️ Important Notes  
- **Currency ID**: Flash will activate automatically.  
- **Medication ID**: Ensure the package is clearly visible.  
- **Document Reading**: Hold steady with good lighting.
